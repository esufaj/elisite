This site is a personal portfolio which showcases a little about me, the skills I possess, the projects I have made and how to contact me.
This website was fully created and designed by me. It is still a work in progress and will be updated as more is added.
This is the first website I have ever created so feedback is very welcome.
I hope anyone who sees it enjoys it because I truly have been having a great time building it.
